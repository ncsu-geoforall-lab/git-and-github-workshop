GitHub
======

https://github.com/


GitHub Enterprise
=================

https://github.ncsu.edu


Gitorious
=========

https://gitorious.org/

It's fully open source (AGPL), anybody can install it on his or her own server, so you are independent on a provider.


Bitbucket
=========

https://bitbucket.org

Can import a repository from any Git online repository 9 (including those which requires authorization) and other online repositories. Can also import all account repositories from GitHub (probably only github.com; but not tested).


Dropbox, Ubuntu One, ownCloud or similar services including your own network shared folder
==========================================================================================

https://www.dropbox.com/
https://one.ubuntu.com/
http://owncloud.org/

All these file cloud services are similar and free of charge to certain extent, and all support all major platforms. Files are by default private but you can share them with unlimited number of people (at least I haven't heard about any limitation).

However, the ownCloud service is different because ownCloud is a free and open source project and there are different providers with different pricing (including free of charge plans). There always should be a possibility (supported by the software itself) to migrate smoothly from one provider to another.
